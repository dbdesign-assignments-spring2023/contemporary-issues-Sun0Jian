### Data clean rooms: An adtech privacy solution?
This article provides some benefits about data clean room -- a special way and limitation for data sharing. While the author affirms clean room concept seems privacy friendly and compliant, he admits that this data clean room policy is still facing challenges.
One of the most obvious challenge is all the data clean room provider announced that they solve the problem about third-party cookie(which could be used to trace users access records on specific website), but none of these providers explained how to do that. 
"The privacy principles have yet to resonate with privacy and information security professionals". Data clean room is surely confirmed its value as data collector, but still can not make all the people trust its privacy.

This is a video interview with Beet.TV, Sweeney, and she is a huge beliver in datta clean room. "We feel like clean rooms is really just a super-safe, compliant, flexible way for publishers like us to share exposure data and for retailers to share their consumer data in a really data-driven, privacy-compliant way." She mentioned many companies use clean room for audience matching and closed loop reporting, and are evolved a few years ago. She thinks clean room is really a safe and high efficiency way to allow media buyers and sellers to match their consumer data without directly sharing data. It has many advantages , and she doesn't mention any disadvantages.
